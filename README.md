The provided Python code implements a quiz game where players answer questions to win monetary rewards. The questions cover various topics related to India, such as geography, history, and culture. Each question is associated with a specific monetary value, and players accumulate winnings as they answer questions correctly. The game ends when a player answers a question incorrectly.

The code structure includes a list of questions, each represented as a sublist containing the question, answer options, and the correct answer index. It also includes a list of monetary values corresponding to each question.

The game prompts players with questions and displays multiple-choice answer options. Players input their answers, and the code validates whether the answer is correct or not. If correct, the player earns the associated monetary reward, and the game proceeds to the next question. If incorrect, the game ends, and the player's total winnings are displayed.

The code provides an interactive and educational way to engage users in learning about India while having fun. It can be easily customized with additional questions or modified for different quiz themes.
